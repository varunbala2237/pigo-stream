#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page reloads automatically on code changes. Lint errors will appear in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
More info: [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`
