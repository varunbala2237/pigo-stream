# PigoStream
  
üéâ Check out deployed project üîó [PigoStream](https://pigostream-site.web.app/)

## Overview

PigoStream is a full-stack streaming platform featuring:

- React frontend deployed on Firebase  
- Node.js/Express backend deployed on Render  
- Firebase for authentication & real-time database  
- Supabase PostgreSQL for session management  
- TMDB API for movies and TV shows metadata  
- Native Flutter Webview player for streaming content

## Backend Service

The backend is a Node.js/Express.js server responsible for:

- Handling recommendation routes  
- Managing user sessions  
- Interacting with Firebase and Supabase databases

### How to Set Up and Deploy the Backend

1. Clone the backend repository or use your backend folder.

2. Install dependencies by running:  
   `npm install`

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables, for example:  
   `PORT=3001`  
   `FIREBASE_CONFIG=your_firebase_config`  
   `SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url`  
   `SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key`  
   `TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key`

5. Run the backend locally with:  
   `npm start`  
   This will start the server on `http://localhost:3001`.

6. To deploy on Render (or any cloud platform):  
   - Push your backend code to a Git repository.  
   - Create a new Web Service on Render and connect the repository.  
   - Set your environment variables in Render‚Äôs dashboard.  
   - Render will automatically build and deploy your backend server.

## Full Project Stack

- üì∫ React frontend hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)  
- üåê Node.js/Express backend hosted on [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/)

## Authentication

- Firebase Authentication manages user sign-up and login  
- Email verification is required to activate accounts

## APIs Used

- TMDB API provides metadata for movies and TV shows  
- Visit [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for more information

## Databases

- Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore for realtime data storage  
- Supabase PostgreSQL used for session pooling

## External Components

- Native Flutter Webview player is integrated for streaming video content

## Getting Started with React Frontend

This React app was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Quick Start

1. Install frontend dependencies:  
   `npm install`

2. Run the app in development mode:  
   `npm start`  
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view it. The app will reload automatically on code changes.

3. Build the app for production:  
   `npm run build`  
   This generates an optimized build in the `build` folder, ready for deployment.
